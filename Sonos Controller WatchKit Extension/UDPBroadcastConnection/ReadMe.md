Framework to send UDP broadcast messages and listen to responses using a [Dispatch](https://developer.apple.com/reference/dispatch) dispatch source.

## Requirements

iOS 9.3+, Swift 5.0

## Usage

An example app is included demonstrating UDPBroadcastConnection's functionality. The example probably won't work for you out of the box since you need someone to listen and respond on the correct UDP port on your network.

### Getting Started

Create a `UDPBroadcastConnection` on port `35602` with a closure that handles the response:

```swift
broadcastConnection = try UDPBroadcastConnection(
  port: 35602,
  handler: { (response: (ipAddress: String, port: Int, response: [UInt8])) -> Void in
    print("Received from \(response.ipAddress):\(response.port):\n\n\(response.response)")
	},
  errorHandler: { (error) in 
    print(error)
  })
```

Note: Make sure to keep a strong reference to `broadcastConnection` (e.g. by storing it in a property) to be able to receive responses.

Send a message via broadcast:

```swift
try broadcastConnection.sendBroadcast("This is a test!")
```

### Try it out

You can test the broadcast and the handler for receiving messages by running the included `receive_and_reply.py`  script (tested with Python 2.7.10) on your Mac. If you send a broadcast with the example app, you should see the message that was sent in the terminal and see the script's answer in the example app.

## Installation

### Carthage

Add the following line to your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile).

```
github "gunterhager/UDPBroadcastConnection"
```

Then run `carthage update`.

### Manually

Just drag and drop the `.swift` files in the `UDPBroadcastConnection` folder into your project.

## License

`UDPBroadcastConnection` is available under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/gunterhager/UDPBroadcastConnection/blob/master/LICENSE) file for details.
